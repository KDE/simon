<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
&kmyapplication; is the main front end for the Simon open source speech recognition solution.

It is a Simond client and provides a graphical user interface for managing the speech model and the commands. Moreover, Simon can execute all sorts of commands based on the input it receives from the server: Simond.
</para>

<para>
In contrast to existing commercial offerings, Simon provides a unique do-it-yourself approach to speech recognition. Instead of predefined, pre-trained speech models, Simon does not ship with any model whatsoever. Instead, it provides an easy to use end-user interface to create language and acoustic models from scratch.
</para>

<para>
Additionally the end-user can easily download created use cases from other users and share his / her own.
</para>

<para>
The current release can be used to set up command-and-control solutions especially suitable for disabled people. However, because of the amount of training necessary, continuous, free dictation is neither supported nor reasonable with current versions of Simon.
</para>

<para>
Because of its architecture, the same version of Simon can be used with all languages and dialects. One can even mix languages within one model if necessary.
</para>
</chapter>


<chapter id="overview">
<title>Overview</title>

<sect1 id="architecture">
<title>Architecture</title>
<para>
The main recognition architecture of Simon consists of three applications.
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>&kmyapplication;</para><para>This is the main graphical interface.</para><para>It acts as a client to the Simond server.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Simond</para><para>The recognition server.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>KSimond</para><para>A graphical front-end for Simond.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
These three components form a real client / server solution for the recognition. That means that there is one server (Simond) for one or more clients (&kmyapplication;; this application). KSimond is just a front-end for Simond which means it adds no functionality to the system but rather provides a way to interact with Simond graphically.
</para>

<para>
Additionally to the Simon, Simond and KSimond other, more specialized applications are also part of this integrated Simon distribution.
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>Sam</para><para>Provides more in-depth control to your speech model and allows to test the acoustic model.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>SSC / SSCd</para><para>These two applications can be used to collect large amount of speech samples from different persons more easily.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Afaras</para><para>This simple utility allows users to quickly check large corpora of speech data for erroneous samples.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Please refer to the individual handbooks of those applications for more details.

</para>

<para>&kmyapplication; is used to create and maintain a representation of your pronunciation and language. This representation is then sent to the server Simond which compiles it into a usable speech model.</para>
<para>&kmyapplication; then records sound from the microphone and transmits it to the server which runs the recognition on the received input stream. Simond sends the recognition result back to the client (&kmyapplication;).</para>
<para>&kmyapplication; then uses this recognition result to execute commands like opening programs, following links, &etc;</para>

<para>Simond identifies its connections with a user / password combination which is completely independent from the underlying operating system and its users. By default a standard user is set up in both Simon and Simond so the typical use case of one Simond server per Simon client will work <quote>out of the box</quote>.</para>
<para> Every Simon client logs onto the server with a user / password combination which identifies a unique user and thus a unique speech model. Every user maintains his own speech model but may use it from different computers (different, physical Simon instances) simply by accessing the same Simond server. One Simond instance can of course also serve multiple users.</para>
<para>If you want to open up the server to the Internet or use multiple users on one server, you will have to configure Simond. Please see the <ulink url="help:/simond">Simond manual</ulink> for details.

<para>
For background information about speech models, please refer to the <link linkend="speech_model">Speech Recognition: Background section</link>.
</para>
</note>

<para>To get Simon to recognize speech and react to it you need to set up a speech model.</para>

<para>Speech models describe how your voice sounds, what words exist, how they sound and what word combination (<quote>sentences</quote> or <quote>structures</quote>) exist.</para>

<para>A speech model basically consists of two parts:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Language model: Describes all existing words and what sentences are grammatically correct </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Acoustic model: Describes how words sound </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>You need both these components to get Simon to recognize your voice.</para>

<para>In Simon, the language model will be created from your active <emphasis>scenarios</emphasis> and the acoustic model will be either built solely through your voice recordings (training) or with the help of a <emphasis>base model</emphasis>.</para>

<sect2 id="scenarios">
<title>Scenarios</title>

<para>
One scenario makes up one complete use case of Simon. To control Firefox, for example, the user just installs the Firefox scenario.
</para>

<para>
In other words, scenarios tell Simon what words and phrases to listen for and what to do when they are recognized.
</para>

<para>
Because scenarios do not contain information about how these words and phrases actually sound, they can be shared and exchanged between different Simon users without problems. To accommodate this community based repository pool, a <ulink url="http://kde-files.org/index.php?xcontentmode=692">category for Simon scenarios has been created on kde-files.org</ulink> where the scenarios, which are just simple text files (XML format), can be exchanged easily.
</para>

<para>
In most cases scenarios are tailored to work best with a specific <link linkend="base_model">base model</link> to avoid <link linkend="phoneme_set_issues">issues with the phoneme set</link>.
</para>

<para>
For information on how to use scenarios in Simon, please refer to the <link linkend="scenarios_use">Scenario section in the Use Simon chapter</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="base_model">
<title>Acoustic model</title>

<para>As mentioned above, you need an acoustic model to activate Simon.</para>

<para>You can either create your own or use and even adapt a base model. Base models are already generated, most often speaker independent, acoustic models that can be used with Simon.</para>

<para>The following table shows what is required, depending on your Simon configuration:

<sect3 id="model_backends">
<title>Backends</title>

<para>
Simon uses external software to build acoustic models and to recognize speech.
</para>

<para>
Usually, these backends can be split into two distinct components: The "model compiler" or "model generation" backend used to create or adapt acoustic models and the "recognizer" used to recognize speech with the help of these models.
</para>

<para>
Not all operation modes of Simon will require a model compiler backend. Please refer to the next section about details on when this is the case.
</para>

<para>Two different backends are supported:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Julius / HTK</para>
<para>Models will be created with the <ulink url="http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk">HTK</ulink>. <ulink url="http://julius.sourceforge.jp/en_index.php">Julius</ulink> will be used as recognizer.</para>
<para>To use this backend, please make sure that you have an up-to-date version of both these tools installed.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>CMU SPHINX</para>
<para>This backend, also often simply referred to as "SPHINX backend", uses the PocketSphinx recognizer and the SphinxTrain model generation backend. Please refer to the <ulink url="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/">CMU SPHINX website</ulink> for more details.</para>
<para>The CMU SPHINX backend requires that Simon is built with the optional SPHINX support. If you have not compiled Simon from source, please refer to your distribution for more information.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>If you are using base models, Simon will automatically select the appropriate backend for you. However, if you want to build your own models from scratch (user-generated model, see below) and have a certain preference, please <ulink url="help:/simond/speech_model_compilation_configuration.html">refer to the Simond configuration</ulink> for more information.</para>

<para>Base models created for one backend are not compatible with any other backend. Please refer to the <link linkend="base_model_compatibility">compatibility matrix</link> for details.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="base_model_types">
<title>Types of base models</title>

<para>
There are three types of base models:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Static base model</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Adapted base model</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>User-generated model</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
For information on how to use base models in Simon, please refer to the <link linkend="base_model_use">Base Models section in the Use Simon chapter</link>.
</para>

<sect4 id="base_model_static">
<title>Static base model</title>

<para>Static base models simply use a pre-compiled acoustic model without modifying it.</para>

<para>Any training data collected through Simon will not be used to improve the recognition accuracy.</para>

<para>This type of model <emphasis>does not</emphasis> require the model creation backend to be installed.</para>

</sect4>

<sect4 id="base_model_adapted">
<title>Adapted base model</title>

<para>By adapting a pre-compiled acoustic model you can improve accuracy by adapting it to your voice.</para>

<para>Collected training data will be compiled in a adaption matrix which will then be applied to the selected base model.</para>

<para>This type of model <emphasis>does</emphasis> require the model creation backend to be installed.</para>

</sect4>

<sect4 id="base_model_user_generated">
<title>User-generated model</title>

<para>When using user-generated models, the user is responsible for training his own model. No base model will be used.</para>

<para>The training data will be used to compile your own acoustic model allowing you to create a system which directly reflects your voice.</para>

<para>This type of model <emphasis>does</emphasis> require the model creation backend to be installed.</para>
</sect4>

<sect3 id="base_model_compatibility">
<title>Requirements</title>

<para>
SPHINX support in Simon must be enabled during compile time and might not be available on your platform. Please refer to your distribution.
</para>
<note>
<para>
The Simon Windows installer includes Julius, PocketSphinx and SphinxTrain but not the HTK. Please refer to the <link linkend="installation">installation section</link> for information on how to install it should you find the need for it.

</sect3>

<sect3 id="base_model_get">
<title>Where to get base models</title>

<para>
Simon base models are packaged as <filename>.sbm</filename> files. If you happen to have raw model files for your backend, you can package them into a compatible SBM container within Simon. Please refer to the <link linkend="configuration_speechmodel">speech model configuration</link> for details.
</para>

<para>
Not all SBM models may work for you. Please refer to the <link linkend="model_backends">model backends section</link> for details.
</para>

<para>
To keep this list of available base models up to date, please refer to <ulink url="http://userbase.kde.org/Special:myLanguage/Simon/Base_models#Where_to_get_base_models">the list in our online wiki</ulink>.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="phoneme_set_issues">
<title>Phoneme set issues</title>

<para>In order for base models to work, both your scenarios and your base model need to use the same set of phonemes.</para>

<para>In practice, this often just means that you need to <emphasis>match scenarios to your base model</emphasis>. The name of &kmyapplication; base models will most likely start with a tag like "[EN/VF/JHTK]". Try to download scenarios that start with the same tag.</para>

<para>
You can not use scenarios designed for different phoneme set (different base model). If Simon recognizes this error, it will try to disable affected words by removing them from the created speech model. These words will be marked with a red background in the vocabulary of the scenario. To re-enable them, transcribe them with the proper phoneme set or use a user-generated model.
</para>

<note>
<title>Hint</title>
<para>If you design a new scenario it is therefore a good idea to use the dictionary that was used to create the base model as shadow dictionary. This way Simon will suggest the <quote>correct</quote> phonemes when adding the words automatically.</para>

<para>The calibration will monitor the current volume and tell you to either raise or lower the volume but you have to do that manually in your systems audio mixer.</para>

<para>During calibration, try to talk normally. Don't yell but don't be overly quiet either. Take into account that you should generally use the same volume setting for all your training and for the recognition too. You might speak a little bit louder (unconsciously) when you are upset or at another time of the day so try to raise your voice a little bit to anticipate this. It is much better to have a little quieter samples than to start clipping.</para>

<para>In the &kmyapplication; settings, both the text displayed and the levels considered correct can be changed. If you leave the text empty, the default text will be displayed. In the options you can also deactivate the calibration completely. See the <link linkend="soundconfiguration_training">training section</link> for more details.</para>

Currently, Simon checks the following criteria:
<itemizedlist>

<para>Sample peak volume</para>
<para>If the volume is too loud and the microphone started to <quote>clip</quote> (<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_%28audio%29">Clipping on wikipedia</ulink>), Simon will display a warning message urging the user to lower the microphone volume.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Signal to noise ratio (SNR)</para>
<para>Simon will automatically determine the signal to noise ratio of each recording. If the ratio is below a configurable threshold, a warning message will be displayed.</para>
<para>The default value of 2300 % means that for Simon to accept a sample as correctly recorded the peak volume has to be 23 times louder than the noise baseline (lowest average over 50 ms).</para>
<para>
Often this can be a result of either a very low quality microphone, high levels of ambient noise or a low microphone gain coupled with a <quote>microphone boost</quote> option in the system mixer.

</para>
</note>

<para>You can either provide a separate prompts file or let Simon extract the transcriptions from the filenames.</para>

<para>When using prompts based transcriptions your prompts file (UTF-8) needs to contain lines of the following content: <quote>[filename] [content]</quote>. Filenames are without file extensions and the content has to be uppercase. For example: <userinput>demo_2007_03_20 DEMO</userinput> to import the file <filename>demo_2007_03_20.wav</filename> containing the spoken word <quote>Demo</quote>.</para>

<para>Because prompts files do not contain a file extension, Simon will try wav, mp3, ogg and flac (in that order). If one of those match, no other extension will be tested and only the first file will be imported (in contrast to file based transcription where all files would be imported).</para>

<para>
When using file based transcriptions, a file called this_is_a_test.wav <emphasis>must</emphasis> contain <quote>This is a test</quote> and nothing else. Numbers and special characters (<quote>.</quote>, <quote>-</quote>,...) in the filename are ignored and stripped.
</para>

<para>Files recorded by Simon 0.2 <emphasis>will</emphasis> follow this naming scheme so you can safely import them using the file name extraction method. Files generated by previous Simon versions should not be imported using this function but you can use the prompts based import for that.</para>

<para>
Imported files and their transcription are then added to the training corpus.

<para>For each device you can determine for what you want the device to be used: Training or recognition (last one only applicable for input devices).</para>

<para>If you use more than one device for training, you will create multiple sound files for each utterance. When using multiple devices for recognition each one feeds a separate sound input stream to the server resulting in recognition results for each stream.</para>

<para>If you use multiple output devices the playback of the training samples will play on all configured audio devices.</para>

<para>When using different sample rates for your input devices, the output will only play on matching output devices.

<para>The configurable font here refers to the text that is recorded to train the acoustic model (through explicit training or when adding a word).</para>

<para>This option has been introduced after we have worked with a few clients suffering spastic disability. While we used the mouse to control Simon during the training, they had to read what was on the screen.

<para>The samplerate set here is the target samplerate of the acoustic model. It has nothing to do with the recording samplerate and it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the samples are actually made available in that format (usually by recording in that exact samplerate or by defining postprocessing commands that resample the files; see the <link linkend="soundconfiguration">sound configuration section</link> for more details).</para>

<para>Usually either 16kHz or 8kHz models are built / used. 16kHz models will have higher accuracy over 8kHz models. Going higher than 16kHz is not recommended as it is very cpu-intensive and in practice probably won't result in higher recognition rates.</para>

<para>Moreover, the path to the training samples can be adjusted. However, be sure that the previously gathered training samples are also moved to the new location. If you use automatic synchronization the Simond would alternatively also provide Simon with the missing sample but copying them manually is still recommended for performance reasons.</para>

<para>
To identify individual users of the system (one Simond server can of course serve multiple Simon clients), Simon and Simond use users. Every user has his own speech model. The username / password combination given here is used to log in to Simond. If Simond does not know the username or the password is incorrect, the connection will fail. See the <ulink url="help:/simond">Simond manual</ulink> on how to setup users for Simond.</para>

<para>The recognition itself - which is done by the server - might not be available at all times. For example it would not be possible to start the recognition as long as the user does not have a compiled acoustic and language model which has to be created first (during synchronization when all the ingredients - vocabulary, grammar, training - are present). Using the option to start the recognition automatically once it is available, Simon will request to start the recognition when it receives the information that it is ready (all <link linkend="needed_parts">required components</link> are available).</para>

<para>
The process of sending the speech input files, compiling them and receiving the compiled versions is called <quote>synchronization</quote>.
Only after the speech model is synchronized the changes take effect and a new restore point is set. This is why per default Simon will always synchronize the model with the server when it changes. This is called <guimenuitem>Automatic Synchronization</guimenuitem> and is the recommended setting.
</para>
<para>
However, if you want more control you can instruct Simon to ask you before starting the synchronization after the model has changed or to rely on manual synchronization all together. When selecting the manual synchronization you have to manually use the <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Actions</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Synchronize</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item of the Simon main window every time you want to compile the speech model.

<sect1 id="speech_model">
<title>Speech recognition: background</title>

<note><para>Before explaining exactly how you can create new scenarios with Simon, this section introduces some fundamental basics to speech recognition in general.</para></note>

<para>
Speech recognition systems take voice input (often from a microphone) and try to translate it into written text. To do that, they rely on statistical representations of human voice. To put it into simple terms: The computer learns how words - or more correctly the sounds that make up those words - sound.
</para>

<para>
A speech model consists of two distinct parts:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>Language Model</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Acoustic Model</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<sect2 id="language_model">
<title>Language Model</title>

<para>The language model defines the vocabulary and the grammar you want to use.</para>

<sect3 id="vocabulary_theory">
<title>Vocabulary</title>
<para>
The vocabulary defines what words the recognition process should recognize. Every word you want to be able to use with Simon should be contained in your vocabulary.
</para>
<para>
One entry in the vocabulary defines exactly one <quote>word</quote>. In contrast to the common use of the word <quote>word</quote>, in Simon <quote>word</quote> means one unique combination of the following:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>Wordname</para><para>(The written word itself)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Terminal</para><para>(Grammatical category; for example: <quote>Noun</quote>, <quote>Verb</quote>, &etc;)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Pronunciation</para><para>(How the word is pronounced; Simon accepts any kind of phonetic as long as it does not use special characters or numbers)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

That means that plurals or even different cases are different <quote>words</quote> to Simon.
This is an important design decision to allow more control when using a sophisticated grammar.
</para>

<para>
In general, it is advisable to keep your vocabulary as sleek as possible. The more words, the higher the chance that Simon might misunderstand you.
</para>

</sect4>

<sect4 id="shadow_dictionary">
<title>Shadow Dictionary</title>
<para>
As said above, the user should keep his vocabulary / dictionary as lean as possible. However, as a word in your vocabulary has to also have information about its pronunciation, it would also be good to have a large dictionary where you could look up the pronunciation and other characteristics of the words.
</para>
<para>
Simon provides this functionality. We refer to this large reference dictionary as <quote>shadow dictionary</quote>. This shadow dictionary is not created by the user but can be imported from various sources.
</para>
<para>
As Simon is a multi-language solution we do not ship shadow dictionaries with Simon. However, it is very easy to import them yourself using the import dictionary wizard. This is described in the <link linkend="import_dictionary">Import Dictionary section</link>.
</para>
</sect4>
<sect4 id="language_profile_general">
<title>Language profile</title>
<para>
Additionally to a shadow dictionary, Simon can use a language profile to provide help with transcribing words.
</para>

<para>A language profile consists of rules how words are pronounced in the target language. It can be likened to the way that humans can often pronounce a word they never heard just because they know some implicit "pronunciation rules" of the language.</para>

<para>Just as with humans, this process is not perfect but can provide a solid starting ground.</para>

<para>This automatic deduction of a phoneme transcription from a written word is called "grapheme to phoneme conversion".</para>

<para>Simon requires the <ulink url="http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Software/g2p.html">Sequitur G2P</ulink> grapheme to phoneme converter to be installed and set up for language profiles to work.</para>

<para>If you have <link linkend="configure_language_profile">selected a pre-built language profile</link> or <link linkend="create_language_profile">built your own</link>, Simon will automatically transcribe new words with it when they are not found in your <link linkend="shadow_dictionary">shadow dictionary</link>.</para>

</sect4>

<sect3 id="grammar_general">
<title>Grammar</title>
<para>

Let's look at an example: You want to use Simon to launch programs and close those windows when you are done. You would like to use the following commands:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para><quote>Computer, Internet</quote> to open a browser</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><quote>Computer, Mail</quote></para><para>To open a mail client</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><quote>Computer, close</quote></para><para>To close the current window</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
Following English grammar, your vocabulary would contain the following:

<para>
To allow the sentences defined above Simon would need the following grammar:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para><quote>Noun Noun</quote> for sentences like <quote>Computer Internet</quote></para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><quote>Noun Verb</quote> for sentences like <quote>Computer close</quote></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
While this would work, it would also allow the combinations <quote>Computer Computer</quote>, <quote>Internet Computer</quote>, <quote>Internet Internet</quote>, &etc; which are obviously bogus.
To improve the recognition accuracy, we can try to create a grammar that better reflects what we are trying to do with Simon.
</para>

<para>
It is important to remember that you define your own <quote>language</quote> when using Simon. That means that you are not bound to grammar rules that exist in whatever language you want to use Simon with. For a simple command and control use-case it would for example be advisable to invent new grammatical rules to eliminate the differences between different commands imposed by grammatical information not relevant for this use case.
</para>

<para>
In the example above it is for example not relevant that <quote>close</quote> is a verb or that <quote>Computer</quote> and <quote>Internet</quote> are nouns. Instead, why not define them as something that better reflects what we want them to be:

  <listitem><para><quote>Trigger Command</quote></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

This allows all the combinations described above. However, it also limits the possibilities to exactly those three sentences. Especially in larger models a well thought grammar and vocabulary can mean a huge difference in recognition results.

</tgroup>
</table>
</para>

<para>
The pronunciation of each word is composed of individual sounds which are separated by spaces. For example, the word <quote>close</quote> consists of the following sounds:

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>k</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>l</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>ow</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>s</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

The acoustic model uses the fact that spoken words are composed of sounds much like written words are composed of letters. Using this knowledge, we can segment words into sounds (represented by the pronunciation) and assemble them back when recognizing. These building blocks are called <quote>phonemes</quote>.
</para>

<para>
Because the acoustic model actually represents how you speak the phonemes of the words, training material is shared among all words that use the same phonemes.
</para>
<para>
That means if you add the word <quote>clothes</quote> to the language model, your acoustic model already has an idea how the <quote>clo</quote> part is going to sound as they share the same phonemes (<quote>k</quote>, <quote>l</quote>, <quote>ow</quote>) at the beginning.
</para>
<para>
To train the acoustic model (in other words to tell him how you pronounce the phonemes) you have to <quote>train</quote> words from your language model. That means that Simon displays a word which you read out loud. Because the word is listed in your vocabulary, Simon already knows what phonemes it contains and can thus <quote>learn</quote> from your pronunciation of the word.

<para>
If the word is listed in the shadow dictionary, Simon automatically fills out all the needed fields (Terminal and Pronunciation).

</para>
<para> All suggestions from the shadow dictionary are listed in the table <guilabel>Similar words</guilabel>. Per default only exact word matches are shown. However, this can be changed by checking the <guilabel>Include similar words</guilabel> check box below the suggestion table. Using similar words you can quickly deduce the correct pronunciation of the word you are actually trying to add. See <link linkend="manual_transcription">below</link> for details.</para>

<para>
Of course this really depends on your shadow dictionary. If the shadow dictionary does not contain the word you are trying to add, the required fields have to be filled out manually.</para>

<para>
Some dictionaries that can be imported with Simon (SPHINX, HTK) do not differentiate between upper and lower case. Suggestions based on those dictionaries will always be uppercase. You are of course free to change these suggestions to the correct case.
</para>

<para>Some dictionaries that can be imported with Simon (SPHINX, PLS and HTK) provide no grammatical information at all. These will assign all the words to the terminal <guilabel>Unknown</guilabel>. You should change this to something appropriate when adding those words.
</para>

<sect4>
<title>Manually Selecting a Terminal</title>
<para>
The terminal of the word is defined as the grammatical category the word belongs to. This might be <guilabel>Noun</guilabel>, <guilabel>Verb</guilabel> or completely new categories like <guilabel>Command</guilabel>. For more information see the <link linkend="grammar">grammar section</link>.</para>
<para>
The list contains all terminals used in both your active and your shadow lexicon and in your grammar.
</para>
<para>
You can add new terminals to the drop-down menu by using the green plus sign next to it.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="manual_transcription">
<title>Manually Providing the Phonetic Transcription</title>
<para>
The pronunciation is a bit trickier. Simon does not need a certain type of phonetics so you are free to use any method as long as it uses only ASCII characters and no numbers. However, if you want to use a shadow dictionary and want to use it to its full potential you should use the same phonetics as the shadow dictionary.
</para>

<para>
If you do not know how to transcribe a word yourself you can easily use your shadow dictionary to help you with the transcription - even if the word is not listed in it. Let's say we want to add the word <quote>Firefox</quote> (to launch firefox) which is of course not listed in our shadow dictionary.
</para>

<para>
(I imported the English voxforge HTK lexicon available from <ulink url="http://voxforge.org/home/downloads">voxforge</ulink> as a shadow dictionary.)
</para>

<para>
<quote>Firefox</quote> is not listed in our shadow dictionary so we do not get any suggestion at all.

</para>

<para>
However, we know that firefox sounds like <quote>fire</quote> and <quote>fox</quote> put together. So let's just open the vocabulary (you can keep the wizard open) by selecting <guibutton>Vocabulary</guibutton> from your Simon main toolbar.
</para>
<para>
  Switch to the shadow vocabulary by clicking on the tab <guilabel>Shadow Vocabulary</guilabel>.</para>
<para>
Use the <guilabel>Filter</guilabel> box above the list to search for <quote>Fire</quote>:

</para>

<para>
We can see, that the word <quote>Fire</quote> is transcribed as <quote>f ay r</quote>. Now filter for <quote>fox</quote> instead of <quote>Fire</quote> and we can see that <quote>Fox</quote> is transcribed as <quote>f ao k s</quote>. We can assume, that firefox should be transcribed as <quote>f ay r f ao k s</quote>.
</para>

<para>
Using this approach of deducing the pronunciation from parts of the word has the distinct advantage that we not only get a high quality transcription but also automatically use the same phoneme set as the other words which were correctly pulled out of the shadow dictionary.
</para>

<para>
We can now enter the pronunciation and change the terminal to something appropriate.

  Because you are about to record some training samples, Simon will display the volume calibration to make sure that your microphone is set up correctly. For more information please refer to the <link linkend="volume_calibration">volume calibration section</link>
</para>

<para>
Simon will try to prompt you for real-world examples. To do that, Simon will automatically fetch grammar structures using the terminal of the word and substitute the generic terminals with example words from your active lexicon.
</para>
<para>
For example: You have the grammar structure <quote>Trigger Command</quote> and have the word <quote>Computer</quote> of the terminal <quote>Trigger</quote> in your vocabulary. You then add a new word <quote>Firefox</quote> of the terminal <quote>Command</quote>. Simon will now automatically prompt you for <quote>Computer Firefox</quote> as it is - according to your grammar - a valid sentence.
</para>
<para>
If Simon is unable to find appropriate sentences using the word (&ie;: No grammar, not enough words in your active lexicon, &etc;) it will just prompt you for the word alone.
</para>
<para>
Although Simon ensures that the automatically generated examples are valid, you can always override its suggestions. Just switch to the <guilabel>Examples</guilabel> tab on the <guilabel>Define Word</guilabel> page.

    <para>If you want to use the terminal <guilabel>Unused</guilabel> in your grammar, you can of course use a different terminal for unused words. Just set the terminal through the <link linkend="edit_word">Edit word</link> dialog.</para>

<para>
Simon provides an easy to use text based interface to change the grammar. You can simply list all the allowed sentences (without any punctuation marks, obviously) like described above.

<para>When selecting a sentence on the left, the right pane will automatically show possible real sentences with the words of your vocabulary on the right.</para>

<para>The example section will list at most 35 examples so if more than that amount of sentences match the selected grammar entry, the list might not be complete.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Import a Grammar</title>
<para>Additionally to simply entering your desired grammar sentence by sentence, Simon is able to automatically deduce allowed grammar structures by reading plain text using the Import Grammar wizard.

</para>

<para>Simon can read and import text files but also provides an input field if you want to simply type the text into Simon.</para>

<para>Say we have a vocabulary like in the general section above:

<para>We want Simon to recognize the sentence <quote>Computer Internet!</quote>. So we either enter the text using the <guibutton>Import text</guibutton> option or create a simple text file with this content <quote>Computer Internet!</quote> (any punctuation mark would work) and save it as <filename>simongrammar.txt</filename> to use the <guibutton>Import files</guibutton> option.

</para>

<para>Simon will then read the entered text or all the given text files (in this case the only given text file is <filename>simongrammar.txt</filename>) and look up every single word in both active and shadow dictionary (the definition in the active dictionary has more importance if the word is available in both). It will then replace the word with its terminal.</para>
<para>In our example this would mean that he would find the sentence <quote>Computer Internet</quote>. Simon would find out that <quote>Computer</quote> is of the terminal <guilabel>Trigger</guilabel> and <quote>Internet</quote> of the terminal <guilabel>Command</guilabel>. Because of this Simon would <quote>learn</quote> that <quote>Trigger Command</quote> is a valid sentence and add it to its grammar.</para>
<para>The import automatically segments the input text by punctuation marks (<quote>.</quote>, <quote>-</quote>, <quote>!</quote>, &etc;) so any natural text should work. The importer will automatically merge duplicate sentence structures (even across different files) and add multiple sentence (all possible combinations) when a word has multiple terminals assigned to it.</para>
<para>The import will ignore sentences where one or more words could not be found in the language model unless you tick the <guilabel>Also import unknown sentences</guilabel> check box in which case those words are replaced with <guilabel>Unknown</guilabel>.</para>

<para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Name</para><para>A descriptive name for the text.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Pages</para><para>The number of <quote>pages</quote> the text consists of. Each page represents one recording.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Recognition Rate</para><para>Analogue to the vocabulary; represents how likely Simon will recognize the words (higher is better). The recognition rate of the training text is the average recognition rate of all the words in the text.</para></listitem>

</para>

<para>
To improve the acoustic model - and thus the recognition rate - you have to record training texts. This means that Simon gets essentially two needed parts:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>Samples of your speech</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Transcriptions of those samples</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The active dictionary is used to transcribe the words (mapping them from the actual word to its phonetic transcription) that make up the text so every word contained in the training text you want to read (train) has to be contained in your active dictionary. Simon will warn you if this is not the case and provide you with the possibility to add all the missing words in one go.
</para>

<para>
The procedure is the same as if you would <link linkend="add_word">add a single word</link> but the wizard will prompt you for details and recordings for all the missing words automatically. This procedure can be aborted at any time and Simon will provide both a way to add the already completely defined words and to undo all changes done so far. When the user has added all the words he is prompted for (all the words missing) the changes to the active dictionary / vocabulary are saved and the training of the previously selected text starts automatically.

<para>The command system can be compared with a group of factory workers.

Whenever Simon recognizes something it is given to <quote>Karl</quote> who then checks if this instruction is meant for him. If he doesn't know what to do with it, it is handed over to <quote>Joe</quote> and so on. If none of the loaded plugins know how to process the input it is ignored. The order in which the recognition result is given to the individual commands (people) is configurable in the command options (<guibutton>Commands</guibutton> > <guibutton>Manage plugins</guibutton>).</para>

</para>

<para>
Each plugin can be associated with a <quote>trigger</quote>. Using triggers, the responsibility of each plugin can be easily be divided.
</para>
<para>Using the factory workers abstraction from above it could be compared to stating the name of who you mean to process your request. So instead of <quote>Open my home folder</quote> you say <quote>Joe, open my home folder</quote> and <quote>Joe</quote> (the plugin responsible for opening folders) will instantly know that the request is meant for him.</para>
<para>In practice you could have commands like the executable command <quote>Firefox</quote> to open the popular browser and the place command <quote>Google</quote> to open the web search engine. If you assign the trigger <quote>Start</quote> to the executable plugin and the trigger <quote>Open</quote> to the place command you would have to say <quote>Start Firefox</quote> (instead of just <quote>Firefox</quote> if you don't use a trigger for the executable plugin) and <quote>Open Google</quote> to open the search engine (instead of just <quote>Google</quote>).</para>
<para>Triggers are of course no requirement and you can easily use Simon without defining any plugin triggers (although many plugins come with a default trigger of <quote>Computer</quote> set which you would have to remove). But even if you use just one trigger for all your commands (like <quote>Computer</quote> to say <quote>Computer, Firefox</quote> and <quote>Computer, Google</quote> like) it has the advantage of greatly limiting the number of false-positives.</para>

<para>Simon's <link linkend="command_dialog">command dialog</link> displays the complete phrase associated with a command in the upper right corner of the command configuration.</para>

<para>You can load multiple instances of one plugin even in one scenario. Each instance can of course also have a different plugin trigger.</para>

<para>
Each Command has a name (which will trigger its invocation), an icon and more fields depending on the type of the plugin (see below).
</para>

<para>
Some command plugins might provide a configuration of the plugin itself (not the commands it contains). These configuration pages will be plugged directly into the action configuration dialog (below the <guimenuitem>General</guimenuitem> menu item) when you load the associated plugin.
</para>

<para>
  Plugins that provide a graphical user interface (like for example the <link linkend="input_number">input number command plugin</link>) can be configured by configuring <guilabel>Voice commands</guilabel>. You can, for example, change the associated word that will trigger the button, but also change the displayed icon, &etc; If you remove all voice interface commands from a graphical element, the element will be hidden automatically.

<title>Input Number</title>
<para>Using the input-number plugin the user can input large numbers easily.</para>


<para>Using the Dictation or the Text-Macro plugin one could associate the numbers with their digits and use that as input method. However, to input larger numbers there are two ways that both have significant disadvantages:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Adding the words <quote>eleven</quote>, <quote>twelve</quote>, &etc;</emphasis></para>
<para>While this seems like the most elegant solution as it would enable the user to say <quote>fivehundredseventytwo</quote> we can easily see that it would be quite a problem to add all these words - let alone train them. What about <quote>twothousandninehundredtwo</quote>? Where to stop?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Spell out the number using the individual digits</emphasis></para>
<para>While this is not as elegant as stating the complete number it is much more practical.</para>
<para>However, many applications (like the great mouseless browsing firefox addon) rely on the user to input large numbers without too much time passing between the individual keystrokes (mouseless browsing for example will wait exactly 500ms per default before it considers the input of the number complete). So if you want to enter 52 you would first say <quote>Five (pause) Two</quote>. Because of the needed pause, the application (like the mouseless browsing plugin) would consider the input of <quote>Five</quote> complete.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
The input number plugin - when triggered - presents a calculator-like interface for inputting a number. The input can be corrected by saying <quote>Back</quote>. It features a decimal point accessible by saying <quote>Comma</quote>. When saying <quote>Ok</quote> the number will be typed out. As all the voice-input and the correction is handled by the plugin itself the application that finally receive the input will only get couple of milliseconds between the individual digits.

  <title>Pronunciation Training</title>

  <para>The pronunciation training, when combined with a good <link linkend="base_model">static base model</link>, can be a powerful tool to improve your pronunciation of a new language.</para>

    </mediaobject>
  </screenshot>
  </para>

  <para>Essentially, the plugin will prompt you to say specific words. The recognition will then recognize your pronunciation of the word and compare it to your speech model which should be a base model of native speakers for this to work correctly. Then Simon will display the recognition rate (how similar your version was to the stored base model).</para>

  <para>The closer to the native speaker, the higher the score.</para>

  <para>The plugin adds an entry to your <guimenu>Commands</guimenu> menu to launch the pronunciation training dialog.</para>

  <para>The training itself consists of multiple pages. Each page contains one word fetched from your active vocabulary. They are identified by a terminal which needs to be selected in the command configuration before starting the training.</para>

  </para>

  <para>The keyboard consists of multiple tabs, each possibly containing many keys. The entirety of tabs and keys are collected in <quote>sets</quote>.</para>

  <para>You can select sets in the configuration but also create new ones from scratch in the keyboard command configuration.</para>

    </mediaobject>
  </screenshot>
  </para>

  <para>Keys are usually mapped to single characters but can also hold long texts and even shortcuts. Because of this, keyboard sets can contain special keys like a <quote>select all</quote> key or a <quote>Password</quote> key (typing your password).</para>

  <para>Next to the tabs that hold the keys of your set, the keyboard may also show special keys like &Ctrl;, &Shift;, &etc; Those keys are provided as voice interface commands and are displayed regardless of what tab of the set is currently active.</para>
  <para>As with all voice triggers, removing the associated command, hides the buttons as well.</para>

  <para>Moreover, the keyboard provides a numpad that can be shown by selecting the appropriate option in the keyboard configuration.</para>

  <para>Next to the number keys and the delete key for the number input field (<guibutton>Number backspace</guibutton>), the numpad provides two options on what to do with the entered number.</para>
  <para>When selecting <guibutton>Write number</guibutton>, the entered number will be written out using simulated key presses. Selecting <guibutton>Select number</guibutton> tries to find a key or tab in the currently active set that has this number as a trigger. This way you can control a complete keyboard just using numbers.</para>

  <para>Dialogs can have more than one text variants - one of which will be randomly picked when the dialog is displayed. This can help to make dialogs feel more natural by providing several, alternative formulations.</para>

  <para>The texts can use <link linkend="dialog_bound_values">bound values</link> and <link linkend="dialog_template_options">template options</link>.</para>

  </para>

  <para>Similar to commands, dialog options have a name (trigger) that, when recognized while the dialog is active and in the option's parent state, will cause this option to activate. Alternatively, options can also be configured to trigger automatically after a set time period. This time is relative to when the state is entered.</para>

  <para>Dialog options, when shown through the <link linkend="dialog_output">graphical output module</link> can show an arbitrary text (that will most likely be equivalent to the trigger but doesn't have to be) and, optionally, an icon. If the text-to-speech output module is used, the text (not the trigger) will be read aloud unless this is disabled by selecting the <guibutton>Silent</guibutton> option.</para>

  <para>Every state can also optionally have an avatar that will be displayed when using the <link linkend="dialog_output">graphical output module</link>.</para>

  <para>The text of dialog states can contain variables - so called "bound values" - that will be filled in during runtime.</para>

The <guilabel>Argument</guilabel> number refers to the index of the placeholder you want to access.</para>
    <para>For example, if your dialog is started with the command "Call %1", and "name" is a command argument bound value, then launching the dialog by recognizing "Call Peter", will turn the dialog text "Are you sure you want to call $name$?" into "Are you sure you want to call Peter?".</para>
